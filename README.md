# Book reads

Application to learn Java and Angular in a real project. Used to keep track of the books that I've read.

## Server

Java with Spring. Initialized with [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/). Using Lombok to speed up development process. <br/>
Uses a Postgresql database to store data. To make development easier. I created a Dockerfile so it runs the database inside of a container.

## Client

Angular like we all know. Just regular state management with DI. Angular 14?
